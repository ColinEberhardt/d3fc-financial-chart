# d3fc-financial-chart

The goals of this project are to:

 - Illustrates the patterns you should consider when creating high performance complex charts
 - Be non-configurable, this isn't a component, it is a pattern / example
 - Demo [D3FC](https://d3fc.io/)
 - Have a very simple UI, no need for selectors (indicators, chart type)
 - Demo the hard stuff (streaming data, pan / zoom / navigator user interactions)

If you need to build a complex, high performance chart, this project will hopefully be a useful template that sets you off in teh right direction.
